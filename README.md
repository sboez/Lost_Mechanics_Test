Technical test - Lost Mechanics Creative developer


## To do

Make a bricks breaker game level inspired by [this one](https://gaming.wimbledon.com/)


## Challenges

:space_invader: **Phaser :** It's the first time I'm working with this framework. It was very fun, intuitive for the gameplay, most challenging for update variables because each scene is independent.

:iphone: **Mobile :** I had some trouble to find a way for fullscreen on mobile device, I have side borders and I couldn't find a good method.


## Assets

:loud_sound: 8-Bit sounds were picked on [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/)


## Improvements / Features 

List of some improvements I'd like to do for my personal breakout game :

- Add animated title screen
- Update input text for validate with enter key
- Add difficulty levels
- Add objects to collect
- Update mobile device game size to see the bounce ball on the top
- Add a scoreboard at the end
- Update assets for a cyberbunk style
